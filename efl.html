    <h1>EFL</h1>
    <p><a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=about">EFL</a>
    (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) is a set of components that can be used
    to build graphical applications.</p>

    <p>Porting of EFL and E17 to Wayland is under active development. Much of
    this work has been done by Christopher Michael (aka devilhorns)</p>

    <p>A blog report about the EFL port to Wayland can be found <a
      href="https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/wayland/">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Getting the source</h2>

    <p>For correct functionality when running under Wayland you must use the
    latest versions of all the EFL components under Wayland. As a precursor to
    these steps you must have downloaded and compiled Wayland as per the <a
      href="/building.html">building instructions</a>.</p>

      <pre>
      $ git clone git://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git
      </pre>

      <h2>Compiling EFL</h2>
      <p>It is important you compile these components in this particular order
      and that the module is installed before moving onto the next one. These
      steps assume that you have the environment variables set as per the <a
        href="building.html">building instructions</a>.</p>

      <p>Along the way you may need to install extra dependencies from your
      distribution.</p>

      <h3>efl</h3>
      <pre>
      $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --enable-wayland --enable-egl --with-opengl=es
      $ make
      $ make install
      </pre>

      <p><strong>With all these components it is important to read the output
        given by configure to ensure the requested options were enabled. You
        may need to look in config.log to identify missing
        dependencies.</strong></p>
      <h2>Running EFL applications under Wayland</h2>

      <p>For applications that use Ecore_Evas directly set the environment
      variable <code>ECORE_EVAS_ENGINE</code> to either
      <code>wayland_shm</code> or <code>wayland_egl</code> depending on
      whether you wish to use the SHM based interface with software rendering
      or use EGL.</p>

      <p>For applications that use Elementary set the environment variable
      <code>ELM_DISPLAY</code> to <code>wl</code>. You may also set the
      environment variable <code>ELM_ACCEL</code> to <code>none</code>
      to use software rendering, or to <code>gl</code> to use hardware
      accelerated rendering.</p>

      <h2>Getting help and reporting issues</h2>

      <p>Issues in the Wayland port of EFL can be reported in the
      Enlightenment <a href="https://phab.enlightenment.org/maniphest/">bug
        tracker</a>.<br />There is also the #edevelop IRC channel on irc.freenode.net</p>
