<p>Before trying to compile and run any of the toolkits below, keep in
mind that they're all in progress and at most at the prototype stage.
While the Wayland core protocol has been stable for some time, experimental
protocols extensions are still changing.</p>

<h2>Qt 5</h2>

<p>Wayland support in the Qt 5 toolkit is happening in the Lighthouse wayland
plugin. To try it out check <a href="qt5.html">Qt 5 Wayland instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>GTK+</h2>

<p>With GTK+ 3.0, GTK+ gained support for multiple backends at runtime and can
switch between backends in the same way Qt can with lighthouse. The Wayland
support is on the upstream GTK+ master branch but disabled by default. You can
find full details in the <a href="gtk.html">GTK+ Wayland instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>Clutter</h2>

<p>The Clutter toolkit has a Wayland backend that allows it to run as a
Wayland client. The backend is in the master branch of the upstream repository. You
can find full details in the <a href="clutter.html">Clutter Wayland instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>SDL</h2>

<p>Experimental Wayland support was added in
<a href="http://libsdl.org/">SDL</a> 2.0.2, disabled by default.</p>

<h2>EFL</h2>

<p>The EFL port to Wayland is under active development - Ecore, Evas and
Elementary have backends that target Wayland for both SHM and EGL based
presentation. Full details can be found in the <a href="efl.html">EFL instructions</a></p>
