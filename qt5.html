<h1>Qt 5 on Wayland</h1>
<p>Wayland support in the Qt 5 toolkit is happening in the Lighthouse
<a href="https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtwayland">Wayland plugin</a>.
The qtwayland repo has a 0.85 branch that will build against Wayland 0.85.
If building qtwayland master, you need to check out the Wayland commit
in the file <a href=
"https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtwayland/blobs/master/wayland_sha1.txt"
>wayland_sha1.txt</a> and the libxkbcommon commit in the file <a href=
"https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtwayland/blobs/master/libxkbcommon_sha1.txt"
>libxkbcommon_sha1.txt</a> in the qtwayland repo (which might not be
compatible with the latest Weston master).</p>

<p>If you also want to build the qtwebkit
browser, you may be better off following the <a
href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/Building_Qt_5_from_Git">directions for
building Qt 5 from git</a>, which builds a lot more.  The init-repository
script does <i>not</i> appropriately return an error when it fails
(unfortunately frequently), so you need to run it manually and make sure
it doesn't print an error.</p>

<p>The third option is the <a
href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt-5-Alpha-building-instructions">Qt 5
Alpha building instructions</a>, which is smaller and more reliable than
the git instructions while still including qtwebkit, but which requires
an LD_PRELOAD for Wayland clients:<br>
<tt>$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfontconfig.so.1
./fancybrowser -platform wayland</tt></p>

<h2>Getting the source and compiling</h2>

<p><b>This section is out of date and will not work.</b>
Instead, <a href="/building.html">build Wayland</a>, follow the <a
href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/Building_Qt_5_from_Git">directions
from Qt for building from git</a>, then build the Wayland module from
Qt's git.</p>
<hr>

<p>To try it out, first clone the qtbase:</p>

<pre>
$ mkdir qt; cd qt
$ git clone git://gitorious.org/qt/qtbase.git
</pre>

<p>You might want to set some env variables for compilation as well:</p>

<pre>
$ export QTVER=qt5
$ export QTDIR=/opt/qt/$QTVER
$ export PATH=$QTDIR/bin/:$PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$QTDIR/lib/pkgconfig/:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
$ export QT_PLUGIN_PATH=$QTDIR/lib/plugins/
</pre>
<pre>$ ./configure -confirm-license -opensource -no-multimedia -no-webkit
-no-phonon -no-v8 -debug -qpa -xcb -wayland -egl -opengl es2 -nomake examples
-prefix ${QTDIR}
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

<p>Here you need to also clone and build qtjsbackend and qtdeclarative: 
git://gitorious.org/qt/qtjsbackend.git
git://gitorious.org/qt/qtdeclarative.git</p>

<p>At this point you have all needed Qt libraries, and needed tools to compile
qtwayland platform:</p>

<pre>
$ cd ../
$ git clone git://gitorious.org/qt/qtwayland.git
$ cd qtwayland/
$ qmake
$ make
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<h2>Trying it out</h2>
<p>First, don't forget to set the XDG directory and re-run .bashrc:</p>

<pre>
$ export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$HOME/.xdg
$ mkdir $HOME/.xdg
</pre>

<p>
You can jump back and forth between Wayland and X ("-platform xcb") to compare the look and feel
of the application under Wayland and X:</p>

<pre>
$ cd ../qtbase/examples/opengl/hellowindow
$ qmake
$ make
$ wayland-compositor &amp;
$ ./hellowindow -platform wayland
</pre>

<h2>Porting your Qt application</h2>

<p>
Qt 5 is structured with the Lighthouse (or Qt Platform) Abstraction, which is
the windowing system and device agnostic architecture. That means Qt can load
in run-time different backend plugins for different window systems as desired.
For instance, an application developed on Qt could be run using "-platform
xcb" and "-platform wayland" for XCB or Wayland respectively (or set
the <code>QT_QPA_PLATFORM</code>) and should have a
similar behavior on both systems, without the need to recompile.
</p>

<p>
Qt abstraction exposes to applications developers two native resources of
Wayland: <code>wl_display</code> and <code>wl_surface</code>. With those types, one could access
Wayland internals to deal with special cases through the interface:
</p>
<pre>
    void *QPlatformNativeInterface::nativeResourceForWindow(const QByteArray &amp;resource, QWindow *window)
</pre>
<p>
Getting the display global handler is quite straightforward, as shown in the
following example:
</p>

<pre>
    QPlatformNativeInterface *native =
        QGuiApplication::platformNativeInterface();
    struct wl_display *wl_dpy = (struct wl_display *)
        native-&gt;nativeResourceForWindow("display", NULL);
</pre>
<p>
and for <code>wl_surface</code>:
</p>

<pre>
    QPlatformNativeInterface *native =
        QGuiApplication::platformNativeInterface();
    struct wl_surface *surface = static_cast&lt;struct wl_surface *&gt;(
        native-&gt;nativeResourceForWindow("surface", this-&gt;windowHandle()));
</pre>


<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
Applications have to implement their own way of decorating windows.
Therefore, some Qt functions like setWindowTitle(), raise() or lower(),
holding window properties will have different effect on Wayland compositors.
  </li>
</ul>
